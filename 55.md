# NIP-55 - Unix Domain Socket Communication

## Defining the file path for UDS

NIP-55 defines a standard way to communicate via Unix Domain Sockets (UDS). UDS needs a file path as a qualifier so that both client and server can agree on a place to exchange information.

The file path will be chosen as `/tmp/nip55`

## Communication

There are potentially many ways to communicate over this socket, one way would be the JSON-RPC collection found in NIP-46.
